# Time Table Automation

This project automates the generation and formatting of academic timetables using Python. It takes into account various constraints (like faculty availability, class timings, etc.) and outputs visually appealing Excel sheets that are easy to read and interpret.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
time-table-automation/
├── main.py                # Main script to generate the raw timetable based on constraints
├── formatter.py           # Script to format the raw Excel timetable into readable versions
├── output/
│   ├── raw_timetable.xlsx # Raw timetable generated by main.py
│   └── formatted/         # Folder containing neatly formatted Excel timetables
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Constraint-Based Generation** (`main.py`):

   * Runs the core logic for timetable generation.
   * Incorporates all predefined rules and constraints.
   * Outputs a raw Excel file: `output/raw_timetable.xlsx`.

2. **Formatting for Clarity** (`formatter.py`):

   * Takes the raw Excel file.
   * Applies styling, layout improvements, and separates different schedules (e.g., by group/division).
   * Saves results in `output/formatted/` with clear, readable formats.

## ✅ Features

* Constraint-based schedule creation.
* Excel export with clean and professional formatting.
* Easy to read, visually appealing layout.
* Modular structure for easy modifications and scaling.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Required Python packages (install with pip):

  ```bash
  pip install pandas openpyxl
  ```

### Running the Project

1. **Generate Timetable**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Format Timetable**:

   ```bash
   python formatter.py
   ```

Formatted files will be available inside `output/formatted/`.

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure to adjust the constraints in `main.py` as per your institute's needs.
* `formatter.py` is flexible and can be customized to match your preferred design.
